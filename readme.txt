== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does Sexy Login support SSL mode? =

Yes.

= Login or Register form doesn't display correctly with reCaptcha enabled. =

Check that you've correctly entered both private and public keys in the "Sexy Login" plugin options.

= I have problems with the Sexy Login redirects and i use a cache system plugin.  =

That's one of the problems of cache systems. We can't modify third party plugins.

= I have problems with Captcha.  =

If you are using another plugin that also uses "reCAPTCHA" it is possible that one of the two "reCAPTCHA" doesn't work correctly. The reason is that "reCAPTCHA" only allows one instance on each page.
